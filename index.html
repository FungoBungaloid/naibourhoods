            <p>None of these Melburnians are real. They're all figments of AI's* imagination.</p>

            <p>I asked one AI to dream up what it believes a 'stereotypical resident' looks like for each suburb in Melbourne, and then asked another AI to show me a picture of them.</p>
        
            <p>This isn't intended to be a thumbs up or down to AI technology. And you'll probably spot the current limits of these tools in some of the personas, images, and text that they've generated. It's just a playful exploration into the world of generative AI models, with Melbourne as the stage.</p>
        
            <h3>So, How was it made?</h3>
        
            <p>I fed a list of Melbourne's suburbs into GPT-4 and asked it to get creative.</p>
        
            <p>It was prompted to conjure up a stereotypical resident for each suburb, complete with all the personal trimmings â€“ their name, age, occupation, hobbies, even a summary of their worldview.</p>
        
            <p>Then, using these virtual personas, GPT-4 also crafted two more things: A quote which captures their spirit, and a prompt for an AI image generation service (Midjourney V6, in this case).</p>
        
            <p>The result? This website! A collection of AI-generated Melburnians, each with their own story, all 100% generated by some of the most capable AI tools currently available.**</p>
        
            <p>So, have a wander through your digital neighborhood. It's a little glimpse into what AI thinks life in Melbourne is like â€“ minus the real people, of course! ðŸ¤–</p>
        
            <p><small>*For those who cringe at calling these tools 'AI' because they aren't 'real' Artificial Intelligence: I hear you, I see you, I agree with you, but the battle has been lost.</small></p>
        
            <p><small>**As of January 2024, at least. Expect all of this to be obsolete in a few months!</small></p>
